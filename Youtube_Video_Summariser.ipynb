              "\"hello everyone I am Santi and I'm currently working as an ml engineer today we are going to do an awesome machine learning project that you can add to your resume and impress all the interviewers um I'm dedicated to teaching machine learning to all of you and to ensure that you all learned an ml job as soon as possible okay so without any further Ado let's Dive Right In so our title is going to be um so our project title is going to be uh YouTube video summarizer with llm well so what's going to do is going to take in a video and you can ask any question regarding the videos contents the images Etc and that's going to be really really good really useful as well and that can be a mini deployed project as well okay so first things first um let's let's let's think about why do we need this in the first place the interviewer might say why not just use chat GPT right because chat gpg has now enabled the search web feature for every free user right so you might be wondering why not just use that okay so let's see why we are not going to use that as you can see right here we have our chat GPT open and let's see um which video are we going to use yeah so this is a video that we are going to use right here as you can see my binary classification video which is of the length of 32 32 minutes okay so let's put this inside the chat GPD and I will the search web feature and say write the transcript for this this for this video because first of all we'll need the transcript right as you can see right here it says that it's unable to actually get the video um transcript so if you don't have the transcript obviously then you won't be able to do anything with it right okay whenever you get any project it's very important to understand that you first need to break the project down into smaller pieces that you can tackle easily this is very important because if you think that how how am I going to do that we don't have this we don't have that at the first so this going to be very confusing so let's tackle it one by one step by step remember this for any project that you are going to do okay I'm going to use Google collab here because we need GPU for our support so if you don't have GPU on your system or you're using any Windows system you're using a Mac system whatever it is it doesn't matter as long as you have Google collab you can just go in it's free for you to use and you can do the project here and in your resume you can just put in link okay so let's do first install let's first install the YouTube transcript API great now we have the YouTube trans transcript API so now what we going to do is basically get the link provide the link to the video um to this library and generate the transcript using this now we're going to import the YouTube transcript API so from YouTube YouTube transcript API sounds good now let's get the video ID from the um video so what we going to do is basically as you know this is the video right here and this is the video ID so whenever you put in a link you're going to get the video ID from here get video ID is going to be this function great you now have the video ID so let's see what the video ID looks like um copy this yeah this is the video ID yeah next thing is getting the transcript so basically get video ID we already have that so let's just store it in a variable this one going to be video ID um yeah sounds good now let's see what the transcript looks like yeah as you can see this is what the transcript looks like so now what you're going to do is uh add all this together yep yeah so now what we going to do is do the transcript join so what does it going to look like exactly just join this together all the text features that you have in this transcript great now we can see what the transcript joint looks like yeah great as you can see right here this is our transcript that we have um okay as you can see we have it Santi but we can't do anything about it so let's just forget about it for the moment yeah um sounds good now what we going to do is basically we need to as you can see the transcript that you saw um it does not actually have a proper punctuation so we going to put in the punctuation now how we're going to do that we're going to use a model for that this is where the llm comes into the play okay so now as you can see like uh restoring the punctuation this is called a library which we have actually and this is actually a restore Punk Library yeah this is our Punk library that we have actually but there's a problem out here the versions are very like old because it's three years ago so that is why there's a patch for the Same by another uh GitHub user so that that is what we are going to use here great so this is actually the thing please note it down because you're going to need this if you use the normal ARB it's not going to help great now the next thing comes is restoring the punctuations so from the r pun we going to import restore puns and then you're going to use this restore Punk function so what this actually does behind the scenes is it uses a model from the hugging face library and this model is actually loaded here and this model is actually pre-trained for taking in bunch of text and then um getting the punctu ation back to that text great now that this is done let's move on to the um getting the results from the punctuation so as you can see right here this one py toch model this model actually got loaded so one thing if you facing some problem with GPU it's very important to use this actually um here yeah as you can see right here we have GPU enable T4 so you need to enable the GPU in your um collab otherwise you're going to get an error that is GPU is not available and it's not really possible to do this without GPU you can do it with CPU as well but it's going to be very slow okay so now that you can see we have loaded the model we have gotten all this vocabulary we have gotten the tokenizer we have gotten the configuration and everything so now we are ready to go let's see the results yeah we are printing out the results as you can see yeah this is as you can see it's like very good punctuation I'm an algorithm full stop I've covered log likelihood it which is kind of a prerequisite full stop then comma a du let start it's pretty good not um 100% accurate because it's not a very good model but it's pretty good we are going to use this okay so the next thing that we're going to do is um we're going to use the chat GPT free version API version to get the results from this transcript so as you can see we have the transcript right here so we know the entire content of the video so it's going to be piece of cake for now sounds good yeah so let's see we going to import open AI as you can see I've already install open a if you have not then you can do it using not equal to pip install open AI to the open AI API key website yeah as you can see right here this has API key you can just log in yeah you can just log in here's my API key you can't see that just create a new secret key write the key permissions all create secret key and you have the API key right here it's a it's it's very easy sounds good now now we have the API key now we are having the prompt so let's have the prompt here so as you can see right here let's go over this so from open we importing open then we have the client with the API key just now we set and now this is the remember this this is very very easy and this is like very standard thing that we going to do so this is the way you have to access the uh openai API so we have the message here roll user content prompt so this is the prompt that we going to pass in um and then we are going to use a model GPT 3.5 turbo because the other GPD models are all paid we're not going to use a paid version we're going to use the free version and we have the temperature set equal to one it controls a Randomness basically Max tokens 2 56 is the maximum number of tokens in the response um top P equal to 1 which means the op is a nuclear sampling parameter which is just another thing for uh like temperature just like temperature we we are determining the one with the higher probability Mass um frequency penalty is basically zero which means that we don't want the model to repeat anything and prence penalty is also zero which means that we do not want it to add unnecessary words or just making it for veros without any reason for example if you're asking for one word just reply with one word don't be any like verbos and explain why you're saying that and all that you don't want that right um so let's run this great now we have the response right here simple thing just print it out so this is the way you can print out the response is very important chat completion. choices z. message. content this is the way it actually comes in so if you want to see what the chat completion looks like you can check it out it's actually kind of a dictionary uh it's kind of a class here where you have different attributes so this is the content that we want um so that is why we are doing this so let's see the content so the test discusses the derivation and maths focusing on binary classification perfect destion boundary uh like likelihood function sigmoid function gradient descent optimal parameters like Theta it controls by discussing how to determine the equation in theeta transpose X comprehensive explanation and its implementation so well it's your cue to go and study this classification um video as well but yeah you can do it at your own pace but it's a very important thing as well sorry not sorry a little bit of promotion but yeah now we done so now you can just take on a prompt which is any kind of prompt that you want uh why don't why just change this let's just have this one right here so let's change it to I don't know anything you want maybe um answer questions based on this text you have right here so let's add a question um what do you want me to add let's say what is classification what is exactly taught here let's see what it has to say algorithm predict the class speaker well it's not my name but whatever we have put it in the transcript so derivation and math specifically binary classification uh okay my gender is also wrong but whatever decision boundary and then dering the this one radiant descent see is perfect the answer is perfect key Concepts it um and steps involving binary classification retailed description as you can see this is extremely good um I also show you how you can deploy this from n to end but that's for another video okay take care bye\""
